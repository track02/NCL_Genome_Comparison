Genome_Comparison
=================

Stage 3 - Project

Classifying genome comparison features through the use of Bayesian Networks



Current To Do List
=================
- Convert BLAST data to ARFF format
- Test/Train Bayesian Network using ARFF files (Looking for matches)
- Expand FileReader - retrieve subject/query start and end points for each match


Future To Do List
=================
- Expand Bayesian Network - classify further features 
- Extract further information from different comparison files (MSPCrunch) / genome sequences
- Consider BioJava library for sequence analysis
- Further Bayes Net training/testing
- FileChooser - allow user to select comparison file
- GUI - display results/queries
- Database setup



Done
=================
- Parse basic match information from BLAST file
- Loading of Bayesian Network, created externally via WEKA GUI
