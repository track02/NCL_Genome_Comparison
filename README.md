Stage 3 - Project

Classifying genome comparison features through the use of Bayesian Networks



To Do
=================
- Convert BLAST data to ARFF format
- Test/Train Bayesian Network using ARFF files

- Expand FileReader - retrieve subject/query start and end points for each match
- Expand Bayesian Network - classify further features 


- Extract further information from different comparison files (MSPCrunch) / genome sequences
                - Allows for new features to be identified
                - Consider BioJava library for sequence analysis



- FileChooser / GUI - allow user to select comparison file





Done
=================
- Parse basic match information from BLAST file
- Loading of Bayesian Network, created externally via WEKA GUI
